# Models

# Setup
To run project locally make sure you have NodeJs installed and:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Svcg17/DailyRecipe.git`.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
3. Create a file named `.env` in the root folder of the project.
    Copy and paste the following inside the file:
    ```
    TOKEN_SECRET="<INSERT TOKEN SECRET>"
    DB="mongodb+srv://dailyrecipepublic:dailyrecipepublicpwd@cluster0.iqkzb.mongodb.net/MyDailyRecipes?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    PORT=5000
    ```
    - TOKEN_SECRET: long string used to encrypt/decrypt the data stored in the jwt token. You can generate a value for the TOKEN_SECRET by using Node's `crypto` library: `require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')`.
    - DB: MongoDB connection string. note: this is a read only connection to the database so you won't be able to create any users or update plans. 
    - PORT: port to run express server on
4. To start the express server on port `5000` run `npm run start`.
5. Go to the client folder `cd client` and repeat step 2.
6. Create a file named `.env` and paste `REACT_APP_HOST=http://localhost:5000` inside. This is host used in the react server.
7. To build the React app run `npm run build`.
6. Open `http://localhost:5000/` and you should see the DailyRecipe website.
